# SOLID-Principles

This repository contains code snippets demonstrating the applications of the five SOLID Principles:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

The code snippets contained within the repository are inspired by the Udemy course entitled "Design Patterns in C# and .NET" by Dmitri Nesteruk would can be accessed via the following link: https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-csharp-dotnet/

The code found within the repository was created as a console application written in C# with .Net 6.0 as the target framework. Every design principle is contained within its own folder, with two seperate classes, namely the scenario class and the solution class. The scenario class demonstrates an implementation that breaks the target design principle, while the solution demonstrates the use of the design principle. A `Program.cs` class contains the main method from which the program is to be run. Code snippets in this file, seperated by appropriate comments, can be commented in and out to run use cases of the scenarios and solutions for each design principle.

A quick summary for each design principle:

- Single Responsibility Principle:
  - Every class should have just a single reason to change, and too much responsibility should not be added to a single class.
  - This lends to the concept of `seperation of concerns`, where different classes should handle different, independant tasks.
  - This further lends to the object oriented idea of composition, where complex systems are built from a multitude of concerns, which interact and depend on one another.
